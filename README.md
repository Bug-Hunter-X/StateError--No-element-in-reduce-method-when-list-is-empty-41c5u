# Dart Reduce Method Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `reduce` method in Dart with an empty list. The `reduce` method throws a `StateError` if the list is empty, as it needs at least one element to perform the reduction operation.

## Bug Description
The provided Dart code uses `reduce` on an empty list, resulting in a `StateError`.  The error occurs because the reduce method requires at least one element to start with.  This leads to unexpected program termination.

## Solution
The solution involves checking for an empty list before calling `reduce`.  If the list is empty, a default value (e.g., 0 for numerical sums) should be returned. This prevents the `StateError` from being thrown.

## How to run the code
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred Dart IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, VS Code).
3. Run the `bug.dart` and `bugSolution.dart` files.
